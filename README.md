# Deep Learning for Emotion Detection in Facial Expressions

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting emotions from facial expressions. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled facial images and will be able to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

## Dataset

We used a publicly available dataset called [CK+](http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/), which consists of facial images labeled with corresponding emotion categories. The dataset contains images of diverse individuals displaying different emotions, making it suitable for training an emotion detection model.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- Keras 2.4+
- OpenCV 3.4+
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:


2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Deep-Learning-for-Emotion-Detection-in-Facial-Expressions
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the dataset:
   
   - Download the CK+ dataset and extract the images.
   - Resize the images to a consistent size.
   - Convert the images to grayscale or RGB format.
   - Normalize the pixel values.

2. Split the dataset:
   
   - Split the preprocessed dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. Model training:
   
   - Define the deep learning model architecture.
   - Train the model on the training set using the labeled data.
   - Optimize the model's parameters using suitable optimization algorithms.

4. Model evaluation:
   
   - Evaluate the trained model on the testing set.
   - Calculate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Deployment:
   
   - Integrate the trained model into a real-world application.
   - Use the model to analyze facial expressions in live video streams.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are well-suited for image-based tasks like emotion detection due to their ability to capture spatial patterns and features. You can experiment with different CNN architectures such as LeNet, VGGNet, ResNet, or Inception to achieve better performance.

## Training

During the training process, the model learns to classify facial expressions into different emotion categories. The training involves optimizing the model's parameters by adjusting the weights and biases to minimize the loss function. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and activation functions can be tuned to improve the model's performance.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate testing set to assess its performance. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to measure how well the model predicts emotions from facial expressions.

## Deployment

Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it in a real-world application. This could involve integrating the model into a web or mobile application or using it to analyze live video streams.
